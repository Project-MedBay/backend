Choose dates according to availability and therapy requirements. 
Appointments can be chosen within a 3-month period and the entire therapy must be completed within 40 days.

Purple highlights signify chosen slots, green denotes available, and gray indicates occupied or filled slots.
Adjacent to "Picked" is a "Duration" counter tracking therapy duration to ensure it doesn't exceed 40 days. 
After selecting all appointments, the user can click the "Next" button.
In the final step (3rd phase) under "My Sessions," the first three chosen appointments are displayed, and by clicking "Expand," the full list is revealed.
